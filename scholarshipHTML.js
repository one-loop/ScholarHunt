The Marshall Scholarship Programme aims to:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 70px; text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Help Scholars gain an understanding and appreciation of contemporary Britain.<br />\n\u2022 Contribute to the advancement of knowledge in science, technology, the humanities and social sciences and the creative arts at Britain\u2019s centres of academic excellence.<br />\n\u2022 Motivate Scholars to act as ambassadors from the USA to the UK and vice versa throughout their lives thus strengthening British American understanding.<br />\n\u2022 Promote the personal and academic fulfilment of each Scholar.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Host Institution(s):</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Any UK university</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Level/Field(s) of study:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Masters degree in any subject, with the <strong>exception</strong> of the following courses:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 70px; text-align: justify;\">\u2022 Second BA/BSc (undergraduate) Degrees<br />\n\u2022 MBA (any university)<br />\n\u2022 MPhil Development Studies (University of Oxford only)<br />\n\u2022 MSc/MFE Financial Economics (any university)<br />\n\u2022 MSc Global Health Science and Epidemiology (University of Oxford only)<br />\n\u2022 MSc International Health and Tropical Medicine (University of Oxford only)<br />\n\u2022 MSc Law and Finance (University of Oxford only)<br />\n\u2022 MPP (Public Policy) (University of Oxford only)<br />\n\u2022 PG Diplomas/Certificates in any subject (any university)<br />\n\u2022 Degrees leading to professional qualifications in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science and law (these degrees typically take 5 years to complete)<br />\n\u2022 Degrees that require extended periods away from the University or the UK, including joint degrees with Universities not in the UK<br />\n\u2022 Distance Learning Degrees<br />\n\u2022 Supervised research not leading to a degree qualification.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Number of Scholarships: </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">50</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Target group:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">US citizens</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Scholarship value/inclusions:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">The scholarship covers university fees, cost of living expenses, annual book grant, thesis grant, research and daily travel grants, fares to and from the United States and, where applicable, a contribution towards the support of a dependent spouse. The total value of a Marshall Scholarship varies according to the circumstances (place of residence, selected university, etc.) of each Scholar but the figure tends on average to be about \u00a338,000 a year.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">The Two Year Marshall Scholarship is tenable for 2 academic years (ie 22 months), but may be extended by the Commission, though not beyond the end of a third academic year. Third-year extensions are granted by the Commission on a limited basis, for strong academic reasons, subject to the availability of funds.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">In addition to the third year funding offered by the Commission:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 70px; text-align: justify;\">\u2022 up to 3 third-year extensions may be granted by the University of Oxford to those pursuing a doctorate at Oxford.<br />\n\u2022 up to 2 third-year extensions may be granted by the Cambridge Trust to those pursuing a doctorate at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">The One Year Marshall Scholarship is tenable for 1 academic year (ie 12 months) and cannot be extended. It is possible to undertake 2 one-year Masters degrees. If the degree proposed is a 1-year programme it will be necessary for the applicant to consider what course of study might be undertaken in the second year. This could be another 1-year degree either at the same institution or at a different UK university or perhaps a research degree.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Eligibility:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Applicants must be United States citizens who, at the time they take up their Scholarship, hold a first degree from an accredited 4-year college or university in the United States with a minimum GPA of 3.7. To qualify for awards tenable from October 2021, candidates must have graduated from their undergraduate college or university after April 2018. Persons already studying for or holding a British degree or degree-equivalent qualification are not eligible to apply for a Marshall Scholarship.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">The Selectors will look for candidates who have the potential to excel as Scholars, as leaders and as contributors to improved UK-US understanding. Assessment will be based on academic merit, leadership potential and ambassadorial potential.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Candidates are only allowed to apply for either the 1 year or the 2 year Marshall Scholarship. Any candidate found applying for both will automatically be disqualified.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Application instructions:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">Applications are made in 1 of 8 regions in the United States. See the official website for the appropriate regional centre the applicant should apply in. Candidates may apply in 1 region only \u2013 either that in which they have their permanent home address or ordinary place of residence/employment, or that in which they are studying. The application closing date is specific to each regional centre, but it generally falls between <strong>late September and early October 2020</strong> for studies commencing September/October 2021.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">Candidates do not need to have applied for or be accepted at a British university before they apply for a Marshall Scholarship. Once a Scholar has been selected, the Commission endeavours to secure placement at the first choice university and course but in the end the decision to accept a Scholar is with the university and not with the Commission. The Marshall Commission cannot, therefore, guarantee that a Marshall Scholar will be admitted to the university of their choice. In the case of Scholars placed at Oxford or Cambridge the Commission will identify the College at which a Scholar should seek a place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">It is important to visit the official website (link found below) for detailed information on how to apply for this scholarship.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Website:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Official Scholarship Website: <a href=\"https://www.marshallscholarship.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.marshallscholarship.org/</a></p>\n"

The Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS) program encourages excellence in graduate studies at publicly-assisted universities in Ontario. Since 1975, the OGS program has been providing merit-based scholarships to Ontario\u2019s best graduate students in all disciplines of academic study. The scholarship program is jointly funded by the Province of Ontario and the University of Toronto. The Province allocates OGS awards to universities specifying the number of awards that each may offer to their students annually.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Host Institution(s):</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">School of Graduate Studies</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Level/Field(s) of study:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Masters and PhD degrees in any subject</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Number of Scholarships: </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">Not stated</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Target group:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Canadian citizens, Canadian permanent residents and protected persons and international students from around the world</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Scholarship value/inclusions:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">The value of the OGS is $5,000 per session. Thus, awardees may receive $10,000 for 2 consecutive sessions or $15,000 for 3 consecutive sessions. In all instances, the awarding graduate unit will contribute to one-third the cost of the total award received by the students.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Each scholarship is tenable for 1 year (i.e., 2 consecutive or 3 academic sessions). The value and duration of each OGS award will be determined by the awarding graduate unit and detailed in the offer letter. Students are limited in the number of years that they may hold an OGS. Master\u2019s students may receive a maximum of 2 years of OGS awards. Doctoral students may receive a maximum of 4 years of OGS awards. Both are subject to a lifetime maximum of 6 years per student.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">In addition, OGS guidelines restrict students to a lifetime maximum of 6 years of government-funded awards and prohibit students from holding an OGS and another government-funded award concurrently.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Eligibility:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Applicants have to be Canadian citizens, Permanent Residents, or Protected Persons under subsection 95(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada), or international students who are studying or plan to study at the University of Toronto under a temporary resident visa (student study permit). They have to be registered or intend to register in an eligible program on a full-time basis for the academic year. An eligible program is defined as a full-time program of study of 2 or 3 sessions at the University of Toronto leading to a graduate degree. A full-time student is one who is in at least 60% of a full course load (40% for students with a permanent disability) or as defined by the University.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">They must have achieved at least A- (or equivalent) in each of the last 2 completed years of study (full-time equivalent); or if the student has completed 2 years of graduate studies at the time of application, the student must only demonstrate an overall average of at least A- (or equivalent) on all graduate courses completed. If marks used for calculating an applicant\u2019s grade point average (GPA) are not available (e.g., courses were graded on a pass-fail basis), then the next most recent available undergraduate or graduate marks should be used to determine eligibility.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">To hold an OGS award, recipients must register and remain enrolled as a full-time student at University of Toronto in an eligible program at the graduate unit from which the OGS was awarded. They must be in good standing with the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP). Applicants who have defaulted on a Canada or Ontario Student Loan, or have failed to make satisfactory repayment on a loan overpayment, are ineligible to receive the award. Those with an OSAP restriction may still apply for the OGS. But if awarded, they must have the restriction cleared within 30 days of notification in order to accept and hold the award.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">Scholars may accept research assistantships, part-time teaching positions, or other paid employment that does not affect their status as a full-time graduate student and is commensurate with the graduate unit policies. Typically, students holding full-time paid employment are not eligible to receive an OGS from the University of Toronto. Scholars also cannot hold an OGS award in the same session (overlapping) or in the same award year as a scholarship from SSHRC, NSERC, CIHR, QEII-GSST, or another OGS.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\">The eligibility criteria provided here are the minimum requirements only. Graduate units may impose additional criteria to apply, receive, or hold an OGS. Students are to inquire with their graduate unit regarding any additional requirements or conditions to those listed here.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Application instructions:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Applications are currently closed.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">Applicants must submit an OGS application to their proposed graduate unit using the University of Toronto School of Graduate Studies centralized online OGS application. Each graduate unit will have their own internal submission deadline to which applicants must adhere (for Fall 2020 entry, the deadlines vary from December 2019 to April 2020). See the official website (link found below) for deadlines imposed by the different Graduate Units.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">Students must submit an OGS application to each institution for which they are seeking admission.
