# 🎓 ScholarHunt
A website that lets you search through scholarships easily by country, university or degree type

## 🧠 Inspiration
As an final year highschool student, finding scholarship opportunities to study abroad is very difficult, especially for the millions of people who require financial aid. So, I decided to build a website that allows users to search for scholarship opportunities by country, university or course. The website gives details about each scholarships as well as eligibility and the amount the scholarships or aid covers. It also gives links to apply for the scholarship

## 📌 What it does
It allows mainly international and low income students from all over the globe to search up financial aid and scholarship opportunities at universities, allowing them to have better opportunities in life.
The site is still unfinished, but I plan on adding further scholarships, finishing the home page (which is still a template) and adding articles to help students maximize their chances of winning scholarships

## How to run
Download the project source code and open the index.html file
Search for scholarships by typing into the searchbar the scholarship by name, country, university or degree type.

## 📕 How we built it
I got the data from webscraping scholarship search sites. My website is different to other similar sites because it has much more scholarships availiable in its database, and allows users to quickly and easily search for scholarships based on the country, university or field of study

## 📝 Challenges we ran into
Getting the data and formatting it properly was difficult. I initially tried to build a site with a backend, but I had problems with deploying the app, so I instead opted with using HTML, CSS and JS to build the entire site.

## ✅ Accomplishments that we're proud of
I really am happy with the UI for the site. It was the first time testing and playing around with UI for a site like this, and I was really happy with how user friendly and good the site looked. It looks more like a site built by an official company rather than a hackathon project finished in a few days

## 📚 What we learned
I learned a lot about webscraping, building user friendly UIs

##🎓 What's next for Scholar Hunt
I didn't have time to get users for the site, but I plan on marketing my website tomorrow on forums and subreddits to help international students and low income students find opportunities for their education. I also plan on adding more scholarships and opportunities I find to the website. Right now I have 456 scholarships listed on the website which I got from web scraping various sites. A lot of the site is still unfinished like the home page, about page and all scholarships page, which I also plan on working on.

## Contributing
Right now I have a bit over 450 scholarships listed on the site, but I still need to do more web scraping and searching to add more and more and maximise the opportunities for people. Any help in searching and adding scholarships to the database will be massively appreciated.
Also, sharing the project with people you think would find it useful would also be nice :)
Thanks
